Published a proposal of RCF 6023 in which it specifies the requirement
   is seldom disturbing or unnecessary, as any implementations
   demand to accept IKEv2 for authentication entirely, while others would like to set up the IKEv2 SA before any actual traffic to protect.
   The extension specified in this paper supports the conception of an
   IKEv2 SA without attempting to build a Child SA.  The terms
   IKEv2, IKEv2 SA, and Child SA and the various IKEv2 negotiations are defined in RFC 5996.
   Without any Child, SA is not a hopeless endeavor for IKEv2 SA. It allows:
        o  Reviewing the current status of the peers.
        o  Quickly setting up things without much delay.
        o  Verification of the peer.
        o  Disclosure of NAT(Network address translation is a process of remapping one IP address space into another by changing network address data in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device) boxes between two hosts on the Internet.
